# LAZY MINTING
Lazy minting basically means that an artist can mint their NFT with Zero gas fees .For 
normal minting artist has to pay a lot of gas fees to create the NFT but in lazy minting 
they don’t have to pay any gas fees . In Lazy minting the NFT is available “off-chain” , or 
outside the blockchain and is minted only when the NFT is sold . This means that the 
artist doesn’t need to pay any fees for the minting process . Here the buyer of the nft pays 
for the purchase and minting nft ,so the artist doesn’t have to pay anything.thing.
